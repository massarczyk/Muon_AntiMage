Muon_AntiMaGe README
simulates muon from an hemisphere
for all muons that are within 5 meters within the modules the full secondaries will be simulated (can change this in the Stepping Action)


Software Requirement
--------------------

ROOT 6.06 or later
CLHEP 2.3.2.2
GEANT 4.10.02

Building
---------

cd  Muon_AntiMaGe/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DGeant4_DIR=$G4LIB ../
make



Interactive Running
--------------------
in build directory...

./Muon_AntiMaGe

this will use the vis.mac macro file to see geometry
vis.mac I use VRML (actually not bad)


Batch Running
--------------------
in build directory...

Muon_AntiMaGe batch.mac >& MuonAntiMaGe.log &
check submit.sh for submitting a number of obs with run number


Output
-------
ROOT file - Muon_AntiMaGe.root

contains histograms and tree
- channel 0..99 veto panels, check definition in DetectorConstruction
- channel 100..199 M1 detectors (Crypstat + Position + String, e.g C1P3D4 is 134)
- channel 200..299 M2 detectors 9

see vetoAnaSim directory for program to analyze output TTree

to remove secondaries - change line 63 of StackingAction to fKill
to get same events set seed to a particular number in main routine
